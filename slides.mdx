## Deno is...

- A new JS runtime (v1.0 released in May)
- Made by the creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl
- Designed to address some of the shortcomings of Node

<Notes>

  - [A new JS runtime] Supports servers & scripts. Aims to do some of the things
  that have been written in Python and Bash, but were made cumbersom by Node
  modules approach.

  - N.B. this talk is mostly covering the Deno docs, and the talk that the
  creator gave on his biggest regrets on Node.

## Let's talk about Node

- Initially released in 2009
- Combines v8 engine with an Event loop and non-blocking I/O
- Designed for server-side JavaScript

<Notes>

  - v8 is fast
  - Lots of concurrent connections, even in a single thread

</Notes>

---

## What happened?

- npm
- Proliferation of tools for client and server JS
- Universal (Isomorphic) JavaScript
- [Nodesplosion](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms?blipid=202005026)

<Notes>

  - npm. Loads of packages.
  - Easy to write, use, adopt, share. This has made JS the standard choice across the industry for web development.
  - Isomorphic. We can write and share Client and server-side JS.

</Notes>

---

## What does Deno do the same?

- It's still just JavaScript
- Combines v8 engine with an Event loop and non-blocking I/O
- Supports bridging between native and JS code

<Notes>

  - Just JS. Aims to be as consistent w/ browser JS as possible.
  - Similar architecture as Node. v8 Event loop, I/O, single thread.
  - You can integrate it with faster native tools if you need to, although the process is different.

```ts
// hello_world.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.58.0/http/server.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 8000 });

for await (const request of server) {
  request.respond({ body: "Hello World!\n" });
}
```

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net ./hello_world.ts
```

<Notes>

  - Similar to how it was.
  - There's a few things that maybe an eagle-eyed dev can pick up in this example.
  - Let's go through them.

</Notes>

---

## What's different?

---

## Deno does not use npm

- Deno is not backwards-compatible with Node

> If you made Deno backwards-compatible, you'd just re-build Node

<Notes>

  - You cannot expect any package on npm to still work.
  - Also, npm is, well, a privately-controlled repository that exerts a huge influence on the Open-Source ecosystem.
  - Watch a talk I'll link you to by CJ, the former NPM CTO.
  - Also, left-pad lol

</Notes>

## Deno does not use package.json

### Q: Why?

<Notes>

- Ryan Dahl views it as a mistake
- I don't quite _get_ or agree with all the decisions... but let's go through his arguments

</Notes>

---

## Deno does not use package.json

### Answer 1: Ambiguity and indirection

```js
// A file executed in Node.js
require('mymodule')  // Where is 'mymodule'?
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "mymodule": "^3.1.4"
  }
}
```

<Notes>

- Ryan Dahl views it as a mistake
- `require()` syntax uses it for module resolution, so it's built in to Node.js.
- `require('mymodule')` is not specific. Need to know where it could come from.
- Need to know `{"dependencies": {"mymodule": "^0.0.1"}}` too.

</Notes>

---

## Deno does not use package.json

### Instead, all external code is imported by URL

```js
import * as log from "https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts";
import liltest from "https://unpkg.com/liltest@0.0.5/dist/liltest.js";
```

---

## Deno does not use package.json

### Common pattern: export files from `./deps.ts`
```ts
// deps.ts
export {
  assert,
  assertEquals,
  assertStrContains,
} from "https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts";
```

---

## Deno does not use package.json

### Answer 2: Boilerplate

- Many extra fields, `license`, `repository`, `description`, etc.
- Just need `dependencies`.

<Notes>

  Can be helpful, but really, we just need `dependencies`

</Notes>

---

## Deno does not use package.json

### Answer 3: Divergence from browser behaviour

- Cements the idea of a module as a directory of files
- In the browser, JS can only be imported as single files

<Notes>

  - Ryan Dahl believes that this is an unnecessary divergence from browser behaviour
  - Keep it like Browser.

</Notes>

## Instead of `node_modules` you have `$DENO_DIR`

<img src={heaviest} />

---

## Instead of `node_modules` you have `$DENO_DIR`

```bash
$ du -h -d0 */node_modules
532M	blossom/node_modules
814M	bubbles/node_modules
448M	fuzzylumpkins/node_modules
707M	him/node_modules
653M	mojo-jojo/node_modules
377M	morbucks/node_modules
326M	utonium/node_modules
```

---

## Instead of `node_modules` you have `$DENO_DIR`

### Pull files once, cache by default

```bash
# Download the dependencies.
> DENO_DIR=./deno_dir deno cache src/deps.ts

# Make sure the variable is set for any command which invokes the cache
> DENO_DIR=./deno_dir deno test src

# Check the directory into source control.
> git add -u deno_dir
> git commit
```

<Notes>

  - What?! Who source-controls a modules directory?
  - Well, there's a school-of-thought that if you're pulling your deps in at production time, you're doing it wrong.
  - I mean, for Docker prod images, we bundle these in.
  - It's certainly more secure.
  - Is deno_dir just a renamed `node_modules`?

</Notes>

---

## All async actions in Deno return a promise

- No more callback hell üéâ
- Top-level await

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.58.0/http/server.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 8000 });

for await (const request of server) {
  request.respond({ body: "Hello World!\n" });
}
```

---

## No more Gyp

- C++ and Rust bindings
- Simplified interface for interacting with native code

<Notes>

  - All system calls are done by message passing
    - A single entrypoint in and out of the VM
    - protobuf serialization
    - Two fns: send and recv.
  - I'll admit this is a bit out of my experience, but hey, the less need to write C++ the better.

</Notes>

---

## TypeScript supported by default

- Put in a `tsconfig.json`, tell Deno where it is, and you're good to go

```bash
$ deno run -c tsconfig.json mod.ts
```

<Notes>

  - Appears to be a design decision of Deno to not do "magic things"
  - if you need something, Deno won't find it for you;
  - You have to say where it is.

</Notes>

---

## Deno is secure by default

- Requires explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access.

```bash
> deno run --allow-net hello_world.ts
```

```bash
> deno run --allow-read=/usr https://deno.land/std/examples/cat.ts /etc/passwd
  error: Uncaught PermissionDenied: read access to "/etc/passwd",
    run again with the --allow-read flag
```

---

## Deno is explicit by default

- File extensions necessary in imports
- No `index.js` shortcuts
- Config needs to be specified to be used, e.g. permissions, TypeScript configuration, etc

---

## Curated, carefully-managed standard libraries

https://deno.land/std

---

## Other nice things

- Deno is a single executable
- Always dies on uncaught errors
- Uses ES Modules everywhere - no more `require()`

<Note>

  - Also, `window` for global.
  - It was and is a dumb name, but `global` in Node was a bad choice because we now don't have browser-compatibilty.

</Note>

## Ideas for script projects

1. Git commit template switcher
1. Strip `.only` calls in tests

## Ideas for server projects

1. Shame bell?
1. `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
