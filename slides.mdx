# Deno

<Notes>

</Notes>

---

## Deno is...

- A new JS runtime (v1.0 released in May)
- Made by the creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl
- Designed to address some of the shortcomings of Node

<Notes>

  - [A new JS runtime] Supports servers & scripts. Aims to do some of the things
  that have been written in Python and Bash, but were made cumbersom by Node
  modules approach.

</Notes>

---

## Let's talk about Node

- Came out ~2009
- Designed for server-side JavaScript
- Single threaded, Event loop, Non-blocking I/O

<Notes>

  - v8 is fast

</Notes>

---


## What does Deno do the same?

- Built on v8
- Single threaded, Event loop, Non-blocking I/O

## Deno does not use npm
## Deno does not have node_modules

- modules referenced as URLs or file paths

---


- modules referenced as URLs or file paths

<Notes>
  Is deno_dir just a renamed `node_modules`?
</Notes>

---

## Deno does not use package.json

- Y tho

---

## All async actions in Deno return a promise
- No more cb hell. Thus Deno provides different APIs than Node.

---

## Deno is secure by default
- Requires explicit permissions for file, network, and environment access.

---

## All modules are imported by URLs

```js
import * as log from "https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts";
```

---

## TypeScript supported by default

- Put in a `tsconfig.json`, tell Deno where it is, and you're good to go

```bash
$ deno run -c tsconfig.json mod.ts
```

<Notes>

  - Appears to be a design decision of Deno to not do "magic things"
  - if you need something, Deno won't find it for you;
  - You have to say where it is.

</Notes>

---

## Other nice things

- Single executable.
- Top-level await.
- Always dies on uncaught errors.
- Uses ES Modules and does not support require()


-------

## Let's talk about vendoring

----

# Node.js approach:
- Source-control specification for dependencies
- Let the build tool `npm` resolve them
-
