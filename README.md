# Deno Slides

Slides for a talk I gave to my team on Deno.

This project uses [mdx-deck][mdx-deck] for the slides, which are specified in [MDX][mdx] syntax [here][slides].

[mdx]: https://mdxjs.com/
[mdx-deck]: https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck
[slides]: ./slides.mdx

To run this project:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

To turn on speaker notes: `Option + P`.
